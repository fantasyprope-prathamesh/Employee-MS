The error you're encountering is related to Gmail's security settings. Google may require you to use an application-specific password when logging in from a non-browser application, like your Node.js server. Here are steps to resolve the issue:

Generate an Application-Specific Password:

Go to your Google Account Security.
Under "Signing in to Google," find "App passwords" and click on "App passwords."
Generate a new app password for your Node.js application. Choose "Other (Custom Name)" as the app and give it a name.
Update Your Node.js Application:

Replace the password in your nodemailer configuration with the application-specific password you generated.
javascript
Copy code
let mailTransporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: "gmail",
  auth: {
    user: "prathameshasynchronouslife@gmail.com",
    pass: "your-application-specific-password" // Use the generated app password here
  }
});
Make sure to replace "your-application-specific-password" with the actual application-specific password you generated in the Google Account settings.

Restart Your Node.js Server:

After making these changes, restart your Node.js server and see if the error persists.
This should resolve the issue. Application-specific passwords are used to enhance the security of your Google account when accessing it from third-party applicationss.
