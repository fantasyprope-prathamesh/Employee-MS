if the initial user is validate using db information then we create jwt token and pass to the client web browser hence the next time the same user login then we check the jwt token which is present in the form of cookie am i right?

Yes, you are absolutely right. Let's break down the authentication flow step by step:

Initial User Login:

When a user logs in for the first time and provides valid credentials, the server authenticates the user by verifying the credentials against the information stored in the database.
If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT token containing the user's information (e.g., user ID, role, etc.) and signs it with a secret key known only to the server.
The server then sends the JWT token as part of the login response to the client (frontend). The client typically stores the token securely, often as a cookie in the browser.
Subsequent User Logins:

When the same user logs in again in the future, the server does not need to re-validate the user's credentials against the database.
Instead, the user provides the JWT token stored in the cookie (or other secure storage) with each subsequent request.
The client includes the JWT token in the Authorization header of the HTTP request, typically in the format Bearer <token>.
The server, upon receiving the request, verifies the JWT token's authenticity and integrity using the secret key it knows.
If the token is valid, the server decodes the token to retrieve the user's information, such as the user's ID, and proceeds with the request based on the user's identity.
So, in summary:

The initial login involves validating the user's credentials against the database and issuing a JWT token.
Subsequent logins only require sending the JWT token with the request, and the server validates the token to identify the user.
By using JWT tokens, you avoid the need to query the database for each subsequent request, making the authentication process more efficient and scalable. The stateless nature of JWT allows for this seamless and secure authentication flow.
