but how right side container give truth value because && is a logical operator

ChatGPT
You are correct; the && operator is a logical operator in JavaScript. In the context of JSX, it's not used as a logical operator but rather as a conditional rendering operator.

In JSX, the && operator is used for short-circuiting to conditionally render elements. When used in this context, it behaves differently from its traditional logical behavior.

Here's how it works:

If the expression on the left of && is truthy, the JSX expression on the right will be evaluated and returned.
If the expression on the left of && is falsy, the entire && expression will return the falsy value, and the JSX expression on the right will not be evaluated or returned.
In the case of the error message, the expression {error} will be truthy when the error state variable contains a non-empty string (e.g., an error message). When {error} is truthy, the JSX expression inside the parentheses (<div className="errorShower">{error}</div>) will be evaluated and returned, effectively rendering the .errorShower container with the error message.

However, when the error state variable is empty or null, the expression {error} will be falsy, and the entire && expression will return the falsy value (i.e., false). In this case, the JSX expression inside the parentheses will not be evaluated or returned, so the .errorShower container will not be rendered on the screen.

So, the && operator is used here for conditional rendering, not for traditional logical operations. It allows us to conditionally include or exclude JSX elements based on the truthiness of an expression.
