if we use empInfo instead of formData in this code then what will happen?

ChatGPT
If you were to use empInfo directly instead of formData in the Axios request, there could be issues, especially when dealing with file uploads. Let's take a look at what might happen:

Form Data Formatting: When you directly pass empInfo (which is a JavaScript object) as the request payload, the data would be sent as JSON. This might not be the format that the server is expecting, especially for file uploads. The server might not be able to correctly interpret the JSON data and handle the file upload.

File Upload Handling: Uploading files requires a specific encoding and format to be sent to the server. Using FormData ensures that the file is properly formatted and included in the request, along with other form data. If you were to use empInfo, the file might not be correctly attached to the request, causing issues with file upload handling on the server side.

Content-Type Header: When you use FormData, Axios sets the Content-Type header appropriately to multipart/form-data. This informs the server that you're sending a form with file uploads. If you use empInfo, Axios might set the Content-Type header to application/json by default, which might not match the server's expectations.

Server Compatibility: Many server-side frameworks and libraries are specifically designed to handle form data and file uploads using the multipart/form-data encoding. Using empInfo directly could lead to compatibility issues with server-side processing.

In summary, using formData when dealing with file uploads and form data is the recommended approach. It ensures that the data is correctly formatted, including file uploads, and that the server can process the request as intended. If you try to use empInfo directly, you might encounter unexpected behavior and issues on the server side due to incorrect formatting and handling of the request payload.
