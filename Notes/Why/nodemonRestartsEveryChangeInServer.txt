if any change happen in server then nodemon will restart the server is it right?
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct! Nodemon is a popular tool used during Node.js development to automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected in the server-side code. It is particularly useful during development as it eliminates the need to manually stop and restart the server every time you make changes to your code.

When you run your Node.js application using Nodemon, it monitors the files in your project directory. Whenever you save a file, Nodemon detects the change and automatically restarts the Node.js server, reflecting the updated changes in real-time. This helps developers in maintaining a smooth development workflow, as they can see the changes they've made without the hassle of manually restarting the server after every code modification.
