Employee Side:
Task List:
Imagine a clean and organized dashboard for employees. In the "Task Management" section, they see a list of tasks assigned to them:

markdown
Copy code
--------------------------
| Task Description       | Due Date    | Status       |
|------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Complete Project Report| 2023-11-15  | In Progress  |
| Review Presentation    | 2023-11-20  | Not Started  |
| Submit Expense Report  | 2023-11-25  | Completed    |
--------------------------
Each row represents a task, and columns provide essential information like the task description, due date, and current status.

Admin Side:
Task Assignment:
Admins have a dedicated interface to assign tasks. It might look like a form with the following fields:

Employee (dropdown menu with employee names)
Task Description (text input)
Due Date (date picker)
Priority (optional, e.g., high, medium, low)
"Assign Task" button to submit the assignment
Task Overview:
Admins also have an overview section where they can see all tasks across employees. This might look like:

markdown
Copy code
---------------------------------------------------
| Employee Name | Task Description | Due Date    | Status       |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| John Doe       | Complete Report  | 2023-11-15  | In Progress  |
| Jane Smith     | Review Presentation| 2023-11-20| Not Started  |
| Mike Johnson   | Submit Expenses  | 2023-11-25  | Completed    |
---------------------------------------------------
Admins can filter or sort tasks based on different criteria, making it easy to manage assignments and monitor progress.

Workflow:
Employee Workflow:
Login: The employee logs into the system.
Navigate to Tasks: The employee goes to the "Task Management" section.

I hope this provides a clearer understanding of how the system might look and function. Feel free to ask if you have any specific questions or if there's a particular aspect you'd like more detail on!

Certainly! Let's break down the admin workflow for task management:

Admin Workflow:
1. Login:
The admin logs into the Employee Management System.

2. Navigate to Tasks:
Once logged in, the admin navigates to the "Task Management" section of the system.

3. View Existing Tasks:
In the "Task Management" section, the admin is presented with an overview of existing tasks assigned to various employees. This might look like:

---------------------------------------------------
| Employee Name | Task Description | Due Date    | Status       |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| John Doe       | Complete Report  | 2023-11-15  | In Progress  |

| Mike Johnson   | Submit Expenses  | 2023-11-25  | Completed    |

The table provides essential details about each task.

4. Assign New Task:
The admin wants to assign a new task. They click on a button or link to open the task assignment form.

---------------------------------------------------
The admin selects an employee, provides task details, sets a due date, and selects a priority level. Clicking the "Assign Task" button submits the task assignment.

5. Confirmation:
After assigning the task, the system provides a confirmation message or visual feedback indicating that the task has been successfully assigned.

6. View Updated Task List:
The admin returns to the task overview, where the newly assigned task is now included in the list.
