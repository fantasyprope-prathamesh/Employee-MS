Implementing task management in an Employee Management System is a great idea! Below, I'll outline the steps you can take and provide a basic graphical representation for both the employee and admin sides.

Implementation Steps:
1. Database Structure:
Add a new table, let's call it tasks, with columns such as task_id, employee_id, task_description, due_date, status, etc.
Establish a foreign key relationship between the tasks table and the employees table based on employee_id.
2. Backend (Node.js and Express):
Create API endpoints for task management (CRUD operations).
Implement functionality to assign tasks to employees, mark tasks as completed, retrieve tasks for a specific employee, etc.
3. Frontend (React):
Create components for task creation, task list, and task details.
For the employee side, display a list of assigned tasks, allowing them to mark tasks as completed.
For the admin side, provide an interface to assign tasks to employees, set due dates, and view overall task status.
Graphical Representation:
Employee Side:
Employee Task Management

Task List:
Displays tasks assigned to the employee.
Each task has details such as task description, due date, and status.
Employees can mark tasks as completed.
Admin Side:
Admin Task Management

Task Assignment:
Admins can assign tasks to specific employees.
Set task details, due dates, and priorities.
Task Overview:
Admins can view an overview of all tasks.
Filter tasks based on status, due date, or employee.
Workflow:
Employee Workflow:
Employee logs into the system.
Navigates to the "Task Management" section.
Views a list of assigned tasks.
Marks tasks as completed.
Admin Workflow:
Admin logs into the system.
Navigates to the "Task Management" section.
Assigns tasks to employees.
Monitors task progress and completion.
Additional Tips:
Implement user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access task management features.
Provide notifications for new task assignments or approaching due dates.
Make the interface user-friendly with intuitive design and navigation.
Remember, this is a basic overview, and you can customize it based on the specific requirements and functionalities you want to include in your Employee Management System.
