Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the design of the Task Overview Table and the corresponding database table.

Database Table Design:
You might create a tasks table in your database with the following columns:

task_id (Primary Key)
employee_id (Foreign Key referencing the employees table)
task_description
due_date
status (e.g., In Progress, Not Started, Completed)
priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
The table might look something like this:

lua
Copy code
-----------------------------
| task_id | employee_id | task_description | due_date   | status       | priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------|--------------|----------|
| 1       | 101         | Complete Report   | 2023-11-15 | In Progress  | High     |
| 2       | 102         | Review Presentation| 2023-11-20| Not Started  | Medium   |
| 3       | 103         | Submit Expenses   | 2023-11-25 | Completed    | Low      |
-----------------------------
In this example, employee_id is a foreign key referencing the employees table, and task_id is the primary key.

Task Overview Table Workflow:
1. Admin Dashboard:
The admin logs in and sees the main dashboard.

2. Navigate to Task Management:
The admin clicks on the "Task Management" section to view and manage tasks.

3. Task Overview Table:
The admin is presented with a table showing an overview of all tasks. Each row represents a task assigned to an employee.

| Task ID | Employee Name | Task Description | Due Date    | Status       | Priority |

| 1       | John Doe      | Complete Report   | 2023-11-15  | In Progress  | High     |
| 2       | Jane Smith    | Review Presentation| 2023-11-20| Not Started  | Medium   |
| 3       | Mike Johnson  | Submit Expenses   | 2023-11-25  | Completed    | Low      |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Filter and Sort Options:
The admin may have options to filter tasks based on employee names, status, due dates, or priority. There might be sorting options to arrange tasks based on different criteria.

5. Task Assignment Form:
Next to the table, there could be a button or link that opens the task assignment form to assign a new task.

Graphic Representation:
Here's a simplified representation:
