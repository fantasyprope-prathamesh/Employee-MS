What is npm init -y
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
npm init -y is a command used in Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to initialize a new npm package (i.e., a Node.js project) with default settings, without any interactive prompts. The -y flag stands for "yes," and it allows the npm init command to automatically answer "yes" to all the prompts that would otherwise require user input.

When you run npm init -y, npm creates a new package.json file in the current directory, which is a JSON file that contains metadata about the project, including the project name, version, description, author, dependencies, and other settings.

Here's an example of using npm init -y:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Node.js project.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm init -y
After running the command, npm will generate a package.json file with default settings in the current directory, without any prompts for user input.
The npm init -y command is useful when you want to quickly set up a new Node.js project and don't need to specify custom settings during the initialization process. It is commonly used in combination with other npm commands to start developing a Node.js application or package without any manual configuration.
